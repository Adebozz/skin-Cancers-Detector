        Basal cell carcinoma is the most common type of skin cancer. It arises
        from the basal cells in the lower epidermis, which are responsible for
        producing new skin cells. Basal cell carcinoma often appears as a waxy
        bump, a non-healing sore, or a pinkish patch on the skin.
      </p>
      <p>
        Causes: 
        <ol>
          <li>Chronic exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation from the sun or
          tanning beds is the most significant risk factor for BCC. </li>
          <li>Fair-skinned individuals and those with a history of sunburns or a family history of
          skin cancer are more susceptible.</li>
          <li> Weakened immune systems, exposure to
          radiation or arsenic, and certain genetic syndromes may also increase
          the risk.</li></ol>
      </p>
      <p>
        Treatment:
        <ol> 
          <li>For small BCCs, surgical procedures like excision, curettage,
        and electrodesiccation (scraping and burning) may be used.</li>
        <li> Mohs surgery, a specialized technique that removes thin layers of cancer-containing
        skin until no cancer cells remain, is often recommended for larger or
        more aggressive tumors.</li>
        <li>Other treatment options include cryotherapy
        (freezing the tumor), laser therapy, and topical medications like
        imiquimod or 5-fluorouracil.</li> </ol>
      </p>
    </div>
    <div id="squamous">
      <p>
        Squamous cell carcinoma is a common type of skin cancer that develops
        from the squamous cells in the outermost layer of the skin. It is
        usually caused by cumulative exposure to the sun over the years and is
        often found on sun-exposed areas, such as the face, ears, and hands.
      </p>
      <p>
        Causes:
        <ol>
          <li>Like BCC, SCC is mainly caused by prolonged exposure to UV
        radiation from the sun or tanning beds. </li>
        <li>Fair-skinned individuals, older
        people, and those with weakened immune systems or a history of chronic
        skin inflammation are at higher risk.</li>
      </p></ol> 
      <p>
        Treatment:
        <ol>
          <li>Surgical excision is the standard treatment for SCC.</li>
          <li>Mohs surgery may also be employed for larger or more aggressive tumors.</li> 
          <li>Radiation therapy can be used for tumors that cannot be easily removed
          surgically. In some cases, topical medications, such as 5-fluorouracil
          or imiquimod, might be prescribed.</li>
        </ol> 
      </p>
    </div>
    <div id="melanoma">
      <p>
        Melanoma is a type of skin cancer that develops from melanocytes, the
        cells that produce melanin (the pigment that gives color to the skin,
        hair, and eyes). It is the most dangerous form of skin cancer and can
        spread to other parts of the body.
      </p>
      <p>
        Causes:
        <ol>
          <li>Melanoma is often associated with intense, intermittent UV
            exposure and sunburns. </li>
        <li>Family history of melanoma, fair skin with
          freckles, multiple moles, and a weakened immune system are risk factors.</li>
        <li>UV radiation from tanning beds is also a risk factor for melanoma.</li>
        </ol> 
        
      </p>
      <p>
        Treatment: 
        <ol>
         <li> Surgical excision is the primary treatment for early-stage
        melanoma. </li>
        <li>In advanced cases, surgical procedures might be combined with
        other treatments, such as chemotherapy, immunotherapy, targeted therapy,
        and radiation therapy. </li>
        <li>Immunotherapy drugs like checkpoint inhibitors
        (e.g., pembrolizumab, nivolumab) and targeted therapy drugs (e.g.,
        vemurafenib, dabrafenib) have shown promising results in treating
        advanced melanoma.</li>
